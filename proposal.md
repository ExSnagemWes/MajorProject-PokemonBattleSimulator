# Project Proposal: ***Pokémon Battle Simulator***
## **Description:**
<p>I will be creating a functional *Pokémon* Battle Simulator. This will be featuring a predefined list of *Pokémon* with stats that were calculated before being entered (stats being calculated from the raw data would be possible, but would also serve no proper purpose as I have no intention of setting them to be adjustable values with customisable IVs, EVs and Natures), a move list (also predefined as incorporating entire movepools would become a horrible mess), move effects, an AI to fight against, and visuals following the general style of *Pokémon* (User *Pokémon* in bottom left, target *Pokémon* in top right, with health horizontally inverse to the sprite).

## **Required Content:**
<p>Battle Engine (Damage Calculator, Damage Initializer)<br>
*Pokémon* Data<br>
Move Data<br>
Simple AI System<br>
Sprite Display Program<p/>


### **Optional Content:**
<p>Customised Move Animations<br>
*Pokémon* Crys<br>
Sound Effects<br>
Strategic AI System **(**akin to playing against myself ideally, as an average level of intelligence**)**<br>
Player Sprites<p/>
