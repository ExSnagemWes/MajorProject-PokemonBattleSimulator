# Project Reflection: ***Pok√©mon Battle Simulator***
## **Challenges:**
<p>In this entire project, the one part I vastly underestimated in difficulty was actually writing the Text Display Interface to respond appropriately with the spacebar, mostly because of how many variables were needed just to get it to properly respond.

## **If I were to try again:**
<p>I would definetly not start with the Type Effectiveness and Pokemon data. I would use a couple piles of filler data for *Pokemon*, write a battle interface that returns sample text, and then calibrate a functional text displayer. Beyond that, I could in theory just adjust the data for the Battle Engine without making any long term changes.<p/>


### **What am I most proud of:**
<p>I am most proud of the actual Damage Calculator function, as even without the rest of the program, a *Pokemon* damage calculator is still a plenty useful tool for a large amount of players, both online and in-game.<p/>

### Other Notes:
<p>I finished all Required EXCEPT the Move Animator, which is about 5 minutes from completion as of writing this assessment, and I totally forgot about the presentation<br>
I will quite likely continue working on this beyond class<p/>
