I need to clone a list. Maps should work

So I need to redirect the pokemon selector to the appropriate list
I have it set to choose whichever list# is defined by function variable LIST in constructor
I need to make these new lists redirect to the backup pokemon data instead of the primary data

I seem to be unable to do this.

so that failed. still refers to the original chart.
second idea: just make it so no duplicates can appear. this means i need to program in another 6 pokemon before progressing further. also it'll be a tad more fun. yes that definetly the point. 100%.

I need to figure out how to remove blank arrays
function blank_array_clear(list){
  let new_list = list;
  for(let i = new_list.length-1; i>=0; i --){
    if (new_list[i] === []){
      new_list.splice(i, 1);
    }
  }
  return new_list;
}
time matters not anymore


I need to make the array-clearer function FUNCTION ~_~
Make stat changes read somehow

WWWRRRRYYYYY
still haven't done stats and now the stupid AI is making mistakes even the Schell-man thinks is weird


add a reader delay 

imma fix the reader later... AI bug still needs to be improved a little

working on the only one of each Pokemon selector function for: class Party.initialize();

initializefinshed math round dumb

just made the program utterly skip blank arrays

and now it skips the second attack for some reason.
Fire = 0.075
Electric = 0.05
Poison = 0.12
